# ü¶Å The ZOO

This project is a web application where users can explore a zoo, view animals, and feed them.  
The focus is on UI/UX, modern styling, and the use of React concepts such as routing, context, and reducers.

The application is built with React, uses SCSS for styling, and fetches live animal data from an external API.
